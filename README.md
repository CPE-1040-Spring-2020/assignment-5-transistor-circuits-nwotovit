**NPN Circuit Measurements**
**Voltage measurements with switch off:**
Voltage across resistor R(c) is 0v.
Voltage at the base, emitter and collector is 0v.
**Current measurements with switch off:**
The current at the collector, emitter, and base is 0 amps. We also know this because I = V/R. If V = 0, then current will always be equal to 0. No current is flowing because no voltage is flowing.

**Voltage measurements with switch on:**
Voltage across resistor R(c) is 2.85v
Voltage from the base relative to ground is .75v 
Voltage from the collector relative to ground is .105v
Voltage from the emitter relative to ground is .006v
**Current measurements with switch on:**
The current at the collector is 6.2 mAmps or .0062 amps     
The current at the base is .3 mAmps or .0003 amps    
The current at the emitter is 6.5 mAmps or .0065 amps 

These measurements show us that the emitter is emitting the sum of the base and collector current. This is also seen because 6.2 + .3 = 6.5 mAmps or .0065 amps.  

The amplification coefficient is about 20 because the ratio of collector:base is approximately 20:1
